Bank Account Simulation

Overview
This project simulates basic bank account operations using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It demonstrates how to implement a simple banking system that supports deposits, withdrawals, account balance management, and transaction history tracking. The code also showcases key OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, and method overriding.
Features
Deposit and Withdraw Methods: Add or remove funds from the account, with checks for negative limits.
Transaction History: Keeps a record of all account activities.
Negative Limit Handling: Prevents withdrawals that exceed the allowed overdraft.
OOP Concepts: Demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, method overriding, and more.
Command-line Interface: Interact with the account using simple terminal prompts.
How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Compile the Java files using the terminal:

javac BankAccount.java SavingsAccount.java BankSimulation.java

Run the simulation:

java BankSimulation

Follow the on-screen instructions to deposit, withdraw, or view your transaction history.
